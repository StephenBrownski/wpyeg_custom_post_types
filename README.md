# WPYEG Custom Post Types Demo
A companion demo plugin to go along with my talk on Custom Post Types at Wordpress Edmonton.

Install the plugin, and the demo post types will be created for you.

A helper text meta-box will be added to the edit views of each post type. This is populated by the post_types 'description' property.
